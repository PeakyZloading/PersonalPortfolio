# PersonalPortfolio

Hey there!

This is my personal portfolio site that I have been working on for the last couple of weeks. I added some basic information about myself and my interests in computer science. I added a few of the projects that I have worked on over the past few years. I also added a contact me page that has some relevant contact information.
